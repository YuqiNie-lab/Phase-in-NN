# Phase-in-NN
This is the code for our project at Princeton (co-authors: Yuqi Nie, Hui Yuan). The paper title is: "Neural Network is heterogeneous: Phase Matters More".
To run the program you need to install tensorflow. Then you may activate your tensorflow environment and import Keras as we have done here.
